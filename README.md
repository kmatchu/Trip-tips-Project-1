# Trip-tips-Project-1
CJ's Travels is a site providing you with a glimpse into the best offerings a US city has to offer. Providing you with cultural attractions, maps, trending news, dinning, weather and more! 

We used a series of inter-connected tubes and very fast gophers to process your request for information and bring it to you directly from the location you are interested in visiting. We believe the series of tubes to be similar to those found in the Mario Brothers Saga. We've collected very special gophers from Prodigy.net and AOL.com after they were let go in the early 1990s. They were happy for the work. No, they have not found Princess Peach in all their travels and are only harassed by carnivorous plants. We'd also like to thank C.J. Jordan for allowing us to use her transportation method to Mexico as our inspiration for our logo. If you'd like one of your own, VW will be selling them starting in 2019.

## Future Development Ideas
Ideally, we'd like to add Augmented Reality to our site to bring you directly (just like the gophers in the series of inter-connected tubes) to the city you're interested in visiting. Imagine clicking "search" and finding yourself in the center of Times Square or the top of a pyramid in Giza. 

Also, we'd really like to get images for more than 265 cities worldwide and to make our site more friendly to international destinations. 

We'd also like to make our site mobile-friendly. 

If you're bored and would like to help us out with any of these, feel free to email CJ@CJsTravels.com!
